# DOSPDFtkMerge

## What does this batch script do?

This DOS batch script uses both ImageMagick (https://www.imagemagick.org/) for Windows and PDFtk (https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) for Windows from the DOS commandline to convert individual image files to PDFs and then merge these PDFs into one multipage PDF.

The original image files will remain in the directory after the script has finished processing, unless the source files are PDF. 

## How to use this batch script.

1. Place a copy of the .bat file in a directory that has image files that needs to be merged into a multipage PDF.
2. Move all other files out of the directory.
3. Double click on the .bat file.
4. Provide inputs for the questions you will be prompted to answer.

### It is recommended that this script be run on a set of copied .TIF images, not on "sole" copies. 

### This script assumes that the computer being used for implementation has PDFtk for Windows installed and that it is working at the commandline.
